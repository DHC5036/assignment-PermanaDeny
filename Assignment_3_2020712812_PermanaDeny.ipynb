It depends on what we are trying to classify. Supposed we build MNIST prediction which has 10 targets from 0 to 9. In this case, the most likely label will help us to decide certain label belongs to the MNIST image.
However, when it comes to medical diagnosis, the most likely label typically leads weak judgement. For instance, we design diabetes prediction with target positive (1) or negative (0). Supposed the classifier says the patient has 0.22% diabetes positive, in other words, the classifier is 78% sure that the diagnosis is negative diabetes. The weak judgment comes by ignoring small risk of 22%, since the risk of diabetes is exist.
